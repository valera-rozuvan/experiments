## Materials used

- original tutorial:
  - [How to create glitch text and image effects in CSS](https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/how-to-create-glitch-text-and-image-effects-in-css)
- HTML5 template:
  - [HTML5 Bones - The template that goes back to basics](https://github.com/iandevlin/html5bones)
- background image taken from here:
  - [HD Wallpaper Of The View Of Sitting On Top Of A Skyscraper](https://paperpull.com/hd-wallpaper-of-the-view-of-sitting-on-top-of-a-skyscraper/)

## Browser compatibility

The effect is based on [clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path) CSS
property, and not all browsers support it yet. However, all the major ones are OK with it. Tested
with latest version of the following browsers:

- Google Chrome `Version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit)`
- Mozilla Firefox `64.0.2 (64-bit)`
- Safari `Version 12.0.2 (14606.3.4)`

## Enjoy ;)
