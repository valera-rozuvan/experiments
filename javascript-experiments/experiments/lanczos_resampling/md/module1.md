Lanczos resampling is an interpolation method used to compute new values for
sampled data. It is often used in multivariate interpolation, for example for
image scaling (to resize digital images), but can be used for any other digital
signal. The Lanczos kernel indicates which samples in the original data, and in
what proportion, make up each sample of the final data.

The filter is named after Cornelius Lanczos, because he showed how to use
Fourier series and Chebyshev polynomials for various problems where they had
not been used before.
