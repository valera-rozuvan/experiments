![imgui with OpenGL 3D animation](screenshots/imgui_with_opengl_3d_animation.png)

Based on the work done by [johnfercher](https://github.com/johnfercher) in PR
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/pull/606 , which didn't land in the official
[imgui repo](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

Tested on Windows with MSVC 2015, and on Linux with the standard GNU compiler.
